# Organize Me
## Full Stack Capstone for Nashville Software School

Organize Me allows the user to track items in their household.  Users can create rooms and items, and store the items in a room, and then add details for that specific item in that room and upload a copy of the receipt for insurance or warranty purposes. The app also allows users to keep track of important dates and to do items, and after an event was completed, they can view their completed events.  Users can also let other users view their events and rooms when they give selected users access.
